# Windows VM Setup

[Official ADDI Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/addi/6.1.2)

This document is based on cookbook that provides a set of recipes that enable you to quickly deploy ADDI with guidance and recommendations.

ADDI requires as dependencies third party applications. Several recommendations and suggestions in terms of version to be used will be presented in this document (see [prerequisites](/Prepare/Stage/prereqs)). 

:::tip
Working with recommended versions and making sure all prerequisites are met will most likely guarantee a successful deployment of ADDI.
:::

## Java Runtime Environment

### Before you install Java:

Make sure that there are no other Java versions installed on the VM or any other versions of Java have been uninstalled. Failing to do so might result an unexpected IBM ADDI behavior.

To check the installed Java version, complete the following steps:

1. Right-click the **Start** menu.
2. Choose the **Terminal** option.
3. Run `java -version` in the command line.
```
java --version
```
5. Check the Java version that is displayed in the terminal window.

### After you successfully install Java:

Complete the following steps to make sure that your Java is properly configured:

1. Click the **Start** menu on Windows system.
2. Type _“advanced"_ in the search bar and then select **View advanced system settings** from the search results.
3. Click **Environment Variables** on the Systems Properties window.
4. Check and make sure that you have the correct `JAVA_HOME` system variable (it should be OK by default) in the System variables list. ![](/img/java_home.jpg)
5. Important: Set the path to the Java installation folder in the System variable list to include the bin folder as in this example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.13\bin`![](/img/java_path_env_vars.jpg)
6. Add the following variables in the System variables list as shown in the following screen capture:
	- Variable name: `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
	- Variable value: `-DEZ_JTDS_SSL=off` ![](/img/java_path_sys_vars.jpg)

## Microsoft SQL Server Configurations

### Recommendations from Original Cookbook
Recommended SQL server version is [SQL Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019)
- Make sure that Microsoft SQL Server instance is configured with a case-insensitive (CI) collation.
- **Important**: IBM ADDI does not support the Microsoft SQL Server instance's collation Latin1_General_CP1254_CI_AS.
- Make sure that Microsoft SQL Server Agent service is started.

### Recommendations gathered from install experience
- SQL Server Express 2019 or 2022 will work for practice and quick projects

### Installation steps
1. Run the installer you've downloaded.
![](/img/sql_server_installation.png)
2. Select the first option on the wizard to install SQL Server.
3. Then select the third option on the wizard to install SQL Server Management Studio. or go directly to the [webpage](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup).

#### **Setting up an SQL user account**:

:::warning
The SQL user account **must** have the privilege to create database, create/delete/update table, create/delete/update index, and execute sql clause.
:::

Complete the following steps to set up an SQL user account:

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio.
2. On the connection screen, make sure to select the "Trust the certificate" checkbox. ![](/img/sql_server_connection.png)
3. Expand **Security > Logins** and then right-click **Logins** and choose **New Login**. Add a login name, select SQL Server Authentication, add a password, and make sure that the default database is set to master. This user is referred to as IBM AD SQL Identity.
:::note
SQL Server Express may require a strong password. Create one that is at least 10 characters in length with numbers and alphanumeric symbols. Example: Ibm1234!Ibm1234!
:::
![](/img/sql_server_login.png)
4. Expand **Databases > System Databases > master > Security > Users** and then right-click **Users** and choose **New User**. Choose the **IBM AD SQL Identity** user by selecting the three dots next to the login name field. Click Browse. And select the user you created in the last step. Then add the same text value to the user name field. ![](/img/sql_server_new_user.png) ![](/img/sql_server_select_login.png) ![](/img/sql_server_browse_objects.png)
5. Expand **Databases > System Databases > master** and then right-click **master** and choose **Properties**. Go to the **Permissions** tab for the **IBM AD SQL Identity** and make sure that permissions are granted for: Create database, Create function, Create procedure, Create table, and Create view. ![](/img/sql_server_permissions.png)

:::note
You must complete the following steps to grant the permission _only if the Rename project feature is used_ in IBM AD Build; otherwise it is not needed.
:::

1. Right-click the SQL server instance and then select **Properties**.
2. In the Server Properties window, select Permissions: From the roles list, select the **IBM AD SQL Identity** and then select to grant for **Alter any database** permission. ![](/img/sql_server_permissions2.png)

### Configuring SQL Server to enable it to accept connection over TCP/iP:

Complete the following steps to configure SQL Server:

1. Start SQL Server Configuration Manager.
2. Select **SQL Server Network Configuration > Protocols for `<Instance ID>`** and make sure that **Shared Memory** and **TCP/iP** are set to **Enabled** ![](/img/sql_server_protocols.png)
3. After Enabling, right click and step into the properties for this protocol. Navigate to the IP Address tab and scroll down to the IPAll Section. Update the TCP port to 1433. ![](/img/sql_server_tcp.png)
3. Restart SQL Server Service. Right click the SQL Server record and click restart. ![](/img/sql_server_restart.png)
4. Additionally you can restart the server within SQL Server Management Studio as well. ![](/img/sql_server_restart2.png)
5. Close or minimize SQL Server Configuration Manager.

:::info Important
SQL Server Configuration Manager writes startup parameters to the registry. They take effect upon the next startup of the SQL Server.
:::

Also, even if SQL server is installed and configured on the same VM as IBM ADDI, depending on the antivirus and firewall settings, restriction issues might surface. If you find yourself in that case, check the [firewall exceptions page](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/addi/6.1.1?topic=prerequisites-tcp-port-requirements-firewall-exceptions).

## Installing IBM AD Connect for Mainframe

For situations where you also plan to use AD Connect for Mainframe, check the [specific instructions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/addi/6.1.1?topic=installing-ad-connect-mainframe) of IBM ADDI Documentation online.

## Installing components with the IBM ADDI Installer

### Before you begin:

:::warning

### Creating a new AD Project

You can create a new AD project by following these steps:

1. Open IBM Application Discovery Build Client. Then, click the new project icon, or click File > New Project from the upper left corner.
2. Select the Mainframe main languages as the project type and go through the New Project Wizard. It will take less than 2 minutes to create the project.
3. After the project is successfully created, you need to add some source code files. For this check, the source code is mostly irrelevant as long as it’s one of the supported languages by AD. Sample source code can be provided by IBM for this particular check.
:::note
Working with AD connect is optional. Choose the next appropriate instructions accordingly.
:::

### Adding source code files

After you create a project, add source code files to retrieve data for further analysis.

#### **For Non-AD Connect users** ( Pilots )

After you create a sample project, you can follow these steps to add source code files and build the project.

1. Expand Sample Project, right-click the appropriate logical folder, and select Add Files to navigate to the location where you already prepared source code files. Then, select the appropriate ones, and click Ok. Repeat this action for all the appropriate logical folders. After the files are added to the logical folder or folders, click Save project icon in the top left corner.
2. Compile the added source code to collect all the necessary data that is needed for AD Analyze Client. You can click the Build Project icon in the top left corner. 

![](/img/ad_build_icon.jpg)

3. When you are prompted to use the Check Project feature, select no, and proceed to build the project. Now, the full build process is started. The time that is needed for the build process depends on the added source code files. You can track the process in the output log window from the bottom part of the application interface. After the build is finished, a summary of the action is presented in the log output window.

Post processing actions are automatically triggered after the build process is finished. By using sample source code, the process will complete in five minutes. These are fully automated, and no user intervention is needed. For more information about checking the status of your created project, see[Monitoring the statuses of the components and projects](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/addi/6.1.1?topic=configurations-monitoring-statuses-components-projects)

#### **For AD Connect users** ( Mainframe Sourced Files )

If you have installed AD Connect, you can follow these steps to add source code files from mainframe by using AD Build Client.
