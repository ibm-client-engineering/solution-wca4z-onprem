# Db2 & Data Gen Setup

This setup is required to perform the **Transform** use case.

## Provisioning WCA service & cloud Db2 database ( Techzone )

A DB2 instance will be provisioned for you in the techzone ibm cloud account.

### Configure DB2 Cloud
1. Once the instance is ready, click on the instance name to go to the Details page
2. Go to **Service credentials** -> **New credential to create new credentials**
    1. These will be used later to connect ADDI to this database: *username*, *password*, *hostname* and *port*. By expanding the section you can see the contents
3. Follow the [Db2 for LUX prerequisites guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/addi/6.1.3?topic=configurations-db2-luw-linux-unix-windows-prerequisites)

Extract and install the IBM Service client 11.5 (Windows x64 version) on the Windows VM.
This should allow you to connect ADDI to the IBM Cloud DB2 instance. 

4. Continue to the [Testing DB2 connectivity from ADDI](#testing-db2-connectivity-from-addi) section

## Provisioning watsonx Code Assistant service and cloud Db2 database ( Non - Techzone )
Provisioning watsonx Code Assistant in IBM Cloud
Follow the instructions in techzone to get access to and set up the watsonx Code Assistant service to use transformation in a POC.

        6. Click **continue**
        7. Download the `v11.5.8_ntx64_dsdriver_ALL_LANG.exe` to your Windows VM
        8. Install the driver using the default options
        9. Open a command prompt on your Windows VM and enter the following commands (you can get the host name and port number from the Db2 Cloud UI 
        at administration -> connections -> Windows):
            ```
            db2cli writecfg add -database bludb -host <Db2 hostname> -port <port>

            ===============================================================================
            db2cli writecfg completed successfully.
            ===============================================================================

            db2cli writecfg add -dsn dashdb -database bludb -host <Db2 hostname> -port <port>


            ===============================================================================
            db2cli writecfg completed successfully.
            ===============================================================================

            db2cli writecfg add -database bludb -host <Db2 hostname> -port <port> -parameter "SecurityTransportMode=SSL"
                

            ===============================================================================
            db2cli writecfg completed successfully.
            ===============================================================================
            ```
### Testing DB2 connectivity from ADDI
1. From the ADDI dashboard, go to **Configure** -> `name of your environment` -> **Servers and security** -> **Relational database server**
    1. Click **Add**
    2. Enter a name
    3. Select `IBM Db2` as database server type
    4. Enter the Db2 Cloud *hostname* (you can get both hostname and port number from administration -> connections -> Windows in the Db2 Cloud UI)
    5. Enter the Db2 Cloud *port* number
    6. Check **Use TLS**
    7. Enter the *name* of the database
    8. Enter the *username* and *password* from the credentials of the Db2 Cloud instance
    9. Click **Test connection** to check if everything works
    10. If the test is successful, click **Save**

### Create a COBOL services ADDI project that uses Db2 Cloud
After you have defined the Cloud Db2 database to ADDI, you can now create an ADDI project and associate it with the Db2 Cloud database. This project is 
for the COBOL services that will be transformed to Java by the AI. For transformation to work means scanning and populating the Cloud database with 
metadata about those COBOL services.

1. Create a new project
    1. Open the IBM Application Discovery Build Client
    2. Go to **File** -> **New Project**
    3. Choose `Mainframe main languages` as project type
    4. Enter a project name
    5. Select `IBM DB2 LUW` as DB Type and for Server Name select your previously created Db2 Cloud instance
    6. Check **Attach to database**
    7. Enter the database name
    8. Click **Next**.
    9. For the project folders you can accept the default and click **Finish**
2. Add project files
    1. *Clone* the COBOL services Git repo that you created to the Windows VM. Unless you have already added some code, you should have empty directories 
    for the COBOL source, copybooks, and DDL.
    2. In the Windows file explorer go to the project path `C:\IBM AD\Mainframe Projects\<Your Project Name>`
    3. *Copy* Cobol programs directory to zOS Cobol and Cobol copybooks to Cobol Include
    4. In the Build Client, right click on **zOS Cobol** -> **Add all files from folder** -> Check that the Folder path is the one where you copied the 
    Cobol programs, then click **OK**
    5. Do the same for Cobol Include
3. Build the project (**Build** -> **Build Project**)
    1. When asked if you want to run the CHECK project first, select `No`
    2. When asked if you’re sure you want to perform the build because it will erase the database, select `Yes`
4. Go to the ADDI dashboard -> **Configure** -> *Select your environment* -> **Services** -> **File Service** -> **Add +**
5. Insert the (same) project path for both Remote and Local
6. Click **Save**
7. In the ADDI dashboard restart the File service


## Setting up the Data Generator
The Data Generator component is supplied as a zip file with the Refactoring Assistant. When you download the Refactoring Assistant and unzip it, you 
should see a `WCA4Z-Data-Generator` zip file.

Install Data Generator

1. Copy the `WCA4Z-Data-Generator` zip file to your Windows VM.
2. Unzip the file (**Right click** --> **Extract All**...) using `C:\Program Files\IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence` as the destination folder
3. After the extraction is done, you should have a new folder `WCA4Z Data Generator `in `C:\Program Files\IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence`

### Configure Data Generator
You should have already set up project synchronization for ADDI, but a sample sync file is shipped with the data generator in case you need it. The end 
to end scenario includes instructions on how to update the synchronization file to include the COBOL services Git repo. So for now, you need to configure 
the data generator to know which ADDI project you are using for COBOL services, the location of the cloned Git repository and the location of the DDL 
within the cloned Git repository.

1. Go to `C:\Program Files\IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence\WCA4Z Data Generator` and open the `conf.properties` file
    1. Edit the values to match your Configuration:
        1. **ADDI_PROJECT_NAME** should have the name of the ADDI COBOL services project you created earlier
        2. **ADDI_PROJECTS_FOLDER** is the folder where ADDI places all your project files
        3. **PROJECT_GITHUB_CLONE_FOLDER** is the folder where you cloned the Github project that contains the COBOL source code, e.g., `C:\git\wca4z-extracted-services`
        4. **DDL_FOLDER** is the DDL folder inside the Github project, e.g., `C:\git\wca4z-extracted-services\DDL`

    In summary, here is an example of a completed `conf.propertie`s file:
        ```
        ADDI_PROJECT_NAME=ExtractedServices1
        ADDI_PROJECTS_FOLDER=C:\IBM AD\Mainframe Projects
        PROJECT_GITHUB_CLONE_FOLDER=C:\git\wca4z-extracted-services
        DDL_FOLDER=C:\git\wca4z-extracted-services\DDL
        ```
2. Open a command prompt and go to `C:\Program Files\IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence\WCA4Z Data Generator`
3. Enter `automation.bat` to run the script. Note that if the cloned Git repo isn’t populated with content because you are going to do the end to end 
scenario, then you don’t need to do this step at this time..
4. In case of any error, you can consult the `runControlFlowGenerator.log` file, that contains the output of the script execution

## Z Open Editor VS Code extension
To use the generative AI capabili4es to transform COBOL to Java, you need to install Visual Studio Code. It’s free to download from the Internet. Once 
installed, you can use the Extensions marketplace to install the Z Open Editor extension from IBM and the Java Language Server extension from RedHat. 
The Z Open Editor extension gives you support for COBOL editing and working with watsonx Code Assistant. The Java extension gives you support for working
 with Java. VS Code has Git support built in.

### Install the VS Code extension:
1. Open VS Code and go to the *Extensions* section (in the left side bar, click on the four little squares)
2. Search for `Z Open Editor` and click **Install**.
3. The installation starts automatically.
4. If the extension is disabled after the installation, this is probably because the workspace isn’t trusted yet:
    1. Click on the little shield symbol
    2. In the new tab that opens click on `Trust Workspace`
5. The extension should now be enabled
6. Close the window to make the sections go into effect

### Configure the extension
1. In the Welcome to Z Open Editor welcome page, expand the section `New: IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z in Z Open Editor` and check the box to enable 
watsonx Code Assistant support.
2. Go to the *Explorer* view and you should see a section called *IBM WATSONX CODE ASSISTANT FOR Z* in the Explorer view.
3. Click on the cog wheel to add your API key. You created your key when you set up the watsonx Code Assistant service. If you ever want to delete your 
API key, simply enter a blank to reset.
You are now ready to start walking through a use case to refactor and transform a COBOL service to Java. The end to end use case uses GenAPP, a sample Application.
