# Windows VM Setup

[Official ADDI Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/addi/6.1.2)

This document is based on cookbook that provides a set of recipes that enable you to quickly deploy ADDI with guidance and recommendations.

ADDI requires as dependencies third party applications. Several recommendations and suggestions in terms of version to be used will be presented in this document (see [prerequisites](/Prepare/Stage/prereqs)). 

:::tip
Working with recommended versions and making sure all prerequisites are met will most likely guarantee a successful deployment of ADDI.
:::

## Java Runtime Environment

### Before you install Java:

Make sure that there are no other Java versions installed on the VM or any other versions of Java have been uninstalled. Failing to do so might result an unexpected IBM ADDI behavior.

To check the installed Java version, complete the following steps:

1. Right-click the **Start** menu.
2. Choose the **Terminal** option.
3. Run `java -version` in the command line.
```bash
java --version
```
5. Check the Java version that is displayed in the terminal window.

### After you successfully install Java:

Complete the following steps to make sure that your Java is properly configured:

1. Click the **Start** menu on Windows system.
2. Type _“advanced"_ in the search bar and then select **View advanced system settings** from the search results.
3. Click **Environment Variables** on the Systems Properties window.
4. Check and make sure that you have the correct `JAVA_HOME` system variable (it should be OK by default) in the System variables list. ![](/img/java_home.jpg)
5. Important: Set the path to the Java installation folder in the System variable list to include the bin folder as in this example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.13\bin`![](/img/java_path_env_vars.jpg)
6. Add the following variables in the System variables list as shown in the following screen capture:
	- Variable name: `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
	- Variable value: `-DEZ_JTDS_SSL=off` ![](/img/java_path_sys_vars.jpg)

## Microsoft SQL Server Configurations

### Recommendations from Original Cookbook
Recommended SQL server version is [SQL Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019)
- Make sure that Microsoft SQL Server instance is configured with a case-insensitive (CI) collation.
- **Important**: IBM ADDI does not support the Microsoft SQL Server instance's collation Latin1_General_CP1254_CI_AS.
- Make sure that Microsoft SQL Server Agent service is started.

### Recommendations gathered from install experience
- SQL Server Express 2019 or 2022 will work for practice and quick projects

### Installation steps
1. Run the installer you've downloaded.
![](/img/sql_server_installation.png)
2. Select the first option on the wizard to install SQL Server.
3. Then select the third option on the wizard to install SQL Server Management Studio. or go directly to the [webpage](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup).

#### **Setting up an SQL user account**:

:::warning
The SQL user account **must** have the privilege to create database, create/delete/update table, create/delete/update index, and execute sql clause.
:::

Complete the following steps to set up an SQL user account:

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio.
2. On the connection screen, make sure to select the "Trust the certificate" checkbox. ![](/img/sql_server_connection.png)
3. Expand **Security > Logins** and then right-click **Logins** and choose **New Login**. Add a login name, select SQL Server Authentication, add a password, and make sure that the default database is set to master. This user is referred to as IBM AD SQL Identity.
:::note
SQL Server Express may require a strong password. Create one that is at least 10 characters in length with numbers and alphanumeric symbols. Example: Ibm1234!Ibm1234!
:::
![](/img/sql_server_login.png)
4. Expand **Databases > System Databases > master > Security > Users** and then right-click **Users** and choose **New User**. Choose the **IBM AD SQL Identity** user by selecting the three dots next to the login name field. Click Browse. And select the user you created in the last step. Then add the same text value to the user name field. ![](/img/sql_server_new_user.png) ![](/img/sql_server_select_login.png) ![](/img/sql_server_browse_objects.png)
5. Expand **Databases > System Databases > master** and then right-click **master** and choose **Properties**. Go to the **Permissions** tab for the **IBM AD SQL Identity** and make sure that permissions are granted for: Create database, Create function, Create procedure, Create table, and Create view. ![](/img/sql_server_permissions.png)

:::note
You must complete the following steps to grant the permission _only if the Rename project feature is used_ in IBM AD Build; otherwise it is not needed.
:::

1. Right-click the SQL server instance and then select **Properties**.
2. In the Server Properties window, select Permissions: From the roles list, select the **IBM AD SQL Identity** and then select to grant for **Alter any database** permission. ![](/img/sql_server_permissions2.png)

### Configuring SQL Server to enable it to accept connection over TCP/iP:

Complete the following steps to configure SQL Server:

1. Start SQL Server Configuration Manager.
2. Select **SQL Server Network Configuration > Protocols for `<Instance ID>`** and make sure that **Shared Memory** and **TCP/iP** are set to **Enabled** ![](/img/sql_server_protocols.png)
3. After Enabling, right click and step into the properties for this protocol. Navigate to the IP Address tab and scroll down to the IPAll Section. Update the TCP port to 1433. ![](/img/sql_server_tcp.png)
3. Restart SQL Server Service. Right click the SQL Server record and click restart. ![](/img/sql_server_restart.png)
4. Additionally you can restart the server within SQL Server Management Studio as well. ![](/img/sql_server_restart2.png)
5. Close or minimize SQL Server Configuration Manager.

:::info Important
SQL Server Configuration Manager writes startup parameters to the registry. They take effect upon the next startup of the SQL Server.
:::

Also, even if SQL server is installed and configured on the same VM as IBM ADDI, depending on the antivirus and firewall settings, restriction issues might surface. If you find yourself in that case, check the [firewall exceptions page](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/addi/6.1.1?topic=prerequisites-tcp-port-requirements-firewall-exceptions).

## Installing IBM AD Connect for Mainframe

For situations where you also plan to use AD Connect for Mainframe, check the [specific instructions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/addi/6.1.1?topic=installing-ad-connect-mainframe) of IBM ADDI Documentation online.

## Installing components with the IBM ADDI Installer

### Before you begin:

:::warning
Make sure that there is no previously installed AD ADDI on the machine. If there is one, you must uninstall it first and clean up any remaining files before proceeding to the next steps.
:::

Complete the following steps to install with the IBM ADDI installer:

1. Double-click the installer file.
2. On the Welcome page, click **Next**.
3. On the Licensing Agreements page, click “I accept the terms of this license agreement”, and then click **Next**.
4. On the Installation Path page, specify the installation path, and then click **Next**. The default installation path is `C:\Program Files\IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence` 
:::tip 
Make sure that you have full read/write permission on the location where AD is installed.
:::
5. If the installation path that you specify does not exist, the target directory is created. Confirm the path and click **OK** in the Message dialog box.
6. On the Select Installation Components page, select the components that you want to install, and then click **Next**. 
:::warning
If you are going to deploy Refactoring Assistant, then you must install the DEX Authentication Service!!!
:::
![](/img/install_addi.jpg)
7. On the IBM Application Discovery Configuration Wizard page, make sure the IBM Application Discovery Configuration Wizard checkbox is selected. The IBM AD Configuration Wizard will open in the system's default browser after the installation is completed. Click **Next**.
	- **Note**: Depending on the machine performance, you might see the “Context root not found” page in your browser. Wait for a minute and then refresh the page until you see IBM AD Configuration Wizard showing in your browser.
8. Specify the configuration service IP address and service port for IBM AD Build Client ( this will be the IP address for the host that ADDI lives on ), and then click **Next**. ![](/img/install_addi_ip.png)
9. On the Setup Shortcuts page, select the shortcuts that you want to create, and then click **Next**.

The installation will take several minutes to complete. Once the installation is complete successfully, a web page will pop-up with which you can proceed to the configuration stage. It is extremely important not to shut down or restart the VM before this stage. 

## Configuring by using IBM AD Configuration Wizard

The **IBM Application Discovery Configuration Wizard** page will open in the system's default browser after the installation is completed.

**Notes**:

- Due to that self-signed certificates are used by default, you are alerted with a warning message in your browser that is similar to the following example. You need to accept the security risk before you continue. To remove the warning, you can upload your own certificates and turn on **Security > HTTPS** through your browser settings. ![](/img/firefox_security_warning.jpg)
- If you need to use **IBM Application Discovery Configuration Wizard** to perform the initial setup at a later time, access https://localhost:9443/ad/admin/setup. It is recommended to use **IBM Application Discovery Configuration Wizard** only once, right after the installation process of **IBM ADDI** product is completed.
- **IBM AD Configuration Wizard** is now multi-language ready. Once you access its web interface, you can select the language menu from the upper right corner and choose one of the available languages. The entire configuration process will be displayed in the selected language.
